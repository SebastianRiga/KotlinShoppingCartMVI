# MVI ShoppingCart Kotlin
An Android ShoppingCart Example App for the MVI Framework written in Kotlin using the Mosby library [Github](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby). This example is based on the awsome MVI tutorial written by Hannes Dorfmann [Link](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby3-mvi-1). It is used as an example in a student thesis comparing the software architectures MVC, MVVM and MVI on Android.
